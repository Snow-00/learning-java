for default java, first compile the java file using javac command, then just run java HelloWorld

methods in java can only return 1 data value

method overloading = methods having the same name but different params

constructor overloading is possible as well

to overcome shadowing variable, use syntax this

if there is a non default constructor (Manager(param){}) then the child must also declare a constructor and if there is more than 1, the child only need to call 1 constructor

about access level (access modifier)
modifier    class   package     subclass    world
public      y       y           y           y
protected   y       y           y           n
no mod      y       y           n           n
private     y       n           n           n

1 public class 1 java file and the name of public class must be the same w/ the file name

interface can implement / extend more than 1 interface

default method in interface is used to make the method to be override optional for the child class
