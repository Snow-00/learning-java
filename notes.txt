for default java, first compile the java file using javac command, then just run java HelloWorld

methods in java can only return 1 data value

method overloading = methods having the same name but different params

constructor overloading is possible as well

to overcome shadowing variable, use syntax this

if there is a non default constructor (Manager(param){}) then the child must also declare a constructor and if there is more than 1, the child only need to call 1 constructor
